# Shop-Application
This application allows a consumer to choose products from the shop and check out with a total amount.
The applcation presents a menu of items for the user to choose from by inputting an option. Once they are done "shopping" they are able to check out.
To run this program please download the source code via the src files and compile using a JRE. 

This was a quick quiz assignment that I completed for my Full Stack Development Apprenticeship with Xpanxion.

If you have any suggestions on how I might be able to build upon or improve this program, I am open to receiving feedback!


Thank you,
